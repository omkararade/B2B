As a data analyst, the task is to work with an ecommerce company in India (referred to as X) that receives a thousand orders daily through their website and must deliver them promptly. To fulfill this task, X has partnered with multiple courier companies in India, which charge them per delivery. The project's aim is to analyze the data to identify patterns andinsights to optimize delivery processes and costs.

For this project, the client (X) is an ecommerce company in India that ships a large volume of orders on a daily basis. The charges for shipping each order are dependent upon two factors:

1. The weight of the product and

2. The distance between the warehouse (pickup location) and the customer's delivery address (destination location).

On average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. X ships 1,00,000 orders per month, which means they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly basis as charges. Given the high cost of these charges, X wants to verify the accuracy of the charges levied by the courier companies to ensure that they are being charged correctly.
